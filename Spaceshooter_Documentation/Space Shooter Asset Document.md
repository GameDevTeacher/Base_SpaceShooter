# Space Shooter Asset Document
### Sprites
**Player**
The player will be a sleek and modern 70’s inspired shape-ship feel. It will also be compact like a small personal cruiser with white and blue colours.

**Enemy**
The enemy ship will use a very similar design to the Players, but with a bit more jagged and dangerous look and mainly use darker colours and red.

**Engine Flame** 
(For Player & Enemy Ships)
The Engine flame will be a small sci-fi glow coming from the end of the ships to indicate movement. Ideally the flame will be white so we can change colour in game.

**Standard Laser projectile**
The Standard Laser projectile is going to have somewhat of an elongated water-drop shape with its tail fading out as if its loosing energy as it goes. 
The Laser will be white and grey scale so we can change colour in game.

**Upgraded Laser projectile**
The Upgraded Laser Projectile is going to be very similar to the standard laser projectile, but will be larger and not have that kind of fade out feel, like it maintains its energy. The Laser will be white and grey scale so we can change colour in game.

**Blast Attack**
(Area of Affect attack - Circle)
The Blast Attack is spreads out as an _energy wave_ in a circle around the ship, increasing in size until it fades out. If time - make animated with crackling energies at the edge of this wave. The Blast will be white and grey scale so we can change colour in game.

**Beam Attack** 
(Long Beam stretching beyond the screen)
The Beam Attack is a thick beam that is almost at the width of the player ship. It should be domelike on one end, as if it’s coming from a very small point.
_Reference_: Gundam Big Beam Attacks!
_((If you have references, include them!! It will make it much easier to explain what you are thinking to the artists))_

**Space background**
A Simple black background with some stars in the distance. Must be “Loopable” meaning that we should be able to repeat the background without seeing it crashing with itself. The Stars should be white so we can change colour in game.

**Small Explosion **
(For Laser hits)
This is a small and simple Puff explosion which is left after a projectile hits an object. Must be animated, 2-5 frames.

**Big Explosion** 
(For Ship Destruction)
This if for ships when they die, a proper space explosion. ((There is no fire in space)). This must be animated, and have between 5-10 frames of animation.

### Sounds
**Background Music**
A catchy 70’s inspired sci fi audio clip, must be at least 1-2 minutes in length and should loop without issue.

**Laser Shoot**
A simple and short laser shooting sound. A bit high pitched beginning and ending in a small rumble. Should not be longer than 1 second.

**Engine rumble**
The sound coming off the Player ship when standing still or moving slow. Should be a short 2-5 second sound that loops perfectly.

**Engine Thrust**
The Sound coming off the Player ship when moving forwards. Should be a short 2-5 second sound that loops perfectly.

**Blast Attack Sound**
This sound should last for 2-3 seconds with a big start and a fade out to the end. It is a big energy wave and should feel impactful. No need for a loop.

**Beam Attack Sound**
This sound should be Big and powerful. 1-2 Seconds with perfect loop. 
_((Might be split into 3 sounds where we have Charge - Shoot - Fade.))_
Reference: Gundam Beam Attacks

**Small Explosion sound**
This is for the small puff explosion when an object is hit with a projectile. 0.5-1 Seconds.

**Big Explosion Sound**
This is for when a ship explodes. Should be energetic but also feel a bit mechanical, like things breaking up amidst the energy. 1-1.5 seconds
