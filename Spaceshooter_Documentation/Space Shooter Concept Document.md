# Space Shooter Concept Document

### Pitch
> _Space Pirates is a game where you advance through a gauntlet of enemy vessels that have come to claim your treasure. Defeat them to become the Pirate King._

### Description
Space Pirates is a Space Shooter style game for Mobile, Web and Desktop Computers. Utilising the classic style of the genre we are shining a light on the very core and what makes the genre great: Tight movement skills that allows the player to delicately navigate a maze of bullets hurled at the player by enemies.

Players will be auto shooting their standard projectiles, which can be upgraded, and they will have the ability to charge up a super attack which can destroy enemy projectiles.

The point of the game is to survive for X minutes, or in Endless Mode, survive as long as possible to get the highest score.
